# MEXA-Hackathon-2025
Mental health challenges are complex, but addressing them doesnâ€™t have to be. 
This application uses AI to bridge the gap between patients and clinicians, 
offering an innovative, data-driven approach to diagnosing and managing mental health issues. 
By incorporating lived experience experts and harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), 
we deliver an efficient and innovative solution while prioritizing ethics, privacy, and the responsible use of technology.
